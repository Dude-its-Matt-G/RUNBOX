<br>
<br>
## Cloning Repo

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Dude-its-Matt-G/RUNBOX.git
```
2. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
3. Rebuild modules
```sh
./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild
```
4. Run the application
```sh
npm run start
```

## Ykush Setup

You will need to enable GPIO control manually as these don't come preconfigured out of the box.
It's fairly simple, just follow Yepkits instructions on their website.
This will mean installing the ykushcmd package in order to communicate with the boards.<br>
https://learn.yepkit.com/tutorial/ykush3-gpio-control-interface<br>
<br>
You will also need to manually solder the header pins for the GPIO on the boards yourself.
If you have never done such a thing, there are youtube videos that explain perfectly on how to successfully solder.<br>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfIwHuGzUEk<br>
<br>
The Ykush3 does not show active port indications when the board it not connected to a computer via the upstream port.
At the time of writing, in order to gain this functionality, you will need to contact Yepkit for a firmware update.
It is not mandatory, just a nicety. You can do this project without this.
<br>
<br>
Connect the Pi to the Ykush boards through GPIO using female to female jumpers as followed
<br>
| Board | Ykush GPIO | Pi Pin # | | Board | Ykush GPIO | Pi Pin # | | Board | Ykush GPIO | Pi Pin # |
|-------|------------|---------|-|-------|------------|---------|-|-------|------------|---------|
|      1|      1     |   08 (GPIO14)    | |          2|      1     |   22 (GPIO25)   | | 3|      1     |   36 (GPIO16)   |
|       |      2     |   10 (GPIO15)   | |       |      2     |   24 (GPIO08)   | |       |      2     |   38 (GPIO20)   |
|       |      3     |   12 (GPIO18)   | |       |      3     |   26 (GPIO07)   | |       |      3     |   40 (GPIO21)   |
<br>
You can change the pins by changing main.js

```javascript
var B1P1 = new Gpio(14, 'out');
var B1P2 = new Gpio(15, 'out');
var B1P3 = new Gpio(18, 'out');

var B2P1 = new Gpio(25, 'out');
var B2P2 = new Gpio(08, 'out');
var B2P3 = new Gpio(07, 'out');

var B3P1 = new Gpio(16, 'out');
var B3P2 = new Gpio(20, 'out');
var B3P3 = new Gpio(21, 'out');

var B4P1 = new Gpio(13, 'out');
var B4P2 = new Gpio(19, 'out');
var B4P3 = new Gpio(26, 'out');
```
The last three lines are for a fourth board I was running at one point.
<br>

## Waveshare Setup

In order to get the Waveshare to display properly you will need to edit the config.txt.
To do so, open the terminal and type:
```
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
```
You will need to add the following:
```
# 1920x1080 monitor (0 means monitor 1 the outside most hdmi port)
hdmi_force_hotplug:0=1
hdmi_group:0=0
hdmi_mode:0=82

# waveshare (inside most hdmi port)
hdmi_force_hotplug:1=1
hdmi_group:1=2
hdmi_mode:1=87
hdmi_cvt:1=1024x600 60
```

*Ensure not to plug the monitors to the wrong ports.*

You will also need to setup the touch screen on the Waveshare.
Now this may differ from time to time especially if you don't have two monitors plugged in. Since I do at all times, for example I have to run this code at startup:
```
xinput map-to-output 9 HDMI-2
```
Please visit this page for instructions on how to tailor this code for your own use:\
https://networks.guru/2018/11/23/using-dual-monitor-dual-touch-screens-on-ubuntu/

the xinput code I have in a startup "user service"

You can follow these instructions to assist in the creation of startup services:\

# Notes üôÉ

* I added an on/off button using the instructions from:
  * https://howchoo.com/g/mwnlytk3zmm/how-to-add-a-power-button-to-your-raspberry-pi
* I use this switch from Amazon because GRTA :)
  * https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SRGG7KF?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2_dt_b_product_details
* I found that my motherboard doesnt like to supply power to all the of these Ykush boards at once and the wall-wart doesnt like it either.<br>
  * As a solution, make sure one board is on external power, the other two are on USB power until I fab up a power supply for the three boards. Ideas are welcome!
* You probably realized that you can change the theme pretty easily. If not, now you know!<br>
Go to https://codepen.io/ for the best experience (in my humble opinion).<br>
This is what I used to get the baseline theme down. In the future, I will provide a link to mine that you can use as a template.
  * Did you make a pretty sick GUI? Fork the project, Add it, and open a pull request!
* I believe I added the script to push the app to the second monitor in main.js lines 30 through 39
